Hello {recipient_name},

My name is {member}, and I am the Director of Finance at Startup Laurier. 
Startup Laurier is an established entrepreneurship club at Wilfrid Laurier University, whose goal is 
to empower students to pursue their entrepreneurial ambitions by providing numerous resources and opportunities.
This upcoming winter term, we are running our annual Winternship program! 
Winternship is a program that we facilitate where we connect amazing startups like 
{startup_name} to Laurier talent! It gives the opportunity for students to work 
unpaid part-time positions during the Winter term (January to April) to gain work experience.
If you're interested, let me know, and we will schedule a quick zoom meeting to discuss logistics and next steps. 
We have attached our Winternship Employer Package with additional information.
 If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Have a great day,

--
